* Rename `event-stream` to `lw-stream`
* `lw-stream` can begin from a marker
* When pull from `lw-stream` store marker somewhere
* `lw.bindTo(7575)`
  * `GET http://localhost:7575/e?from=X&limit=Y`
* `lw-http-stream` like `lw-stream` but over HTTP
* `merge-stream` to merge multiple infinite streams with back pressure support


# What To Try Next
* Expose http route to get acquisition report `http://localhost/ar?day=20140118`
* Try to fold more events
* Try to create a more complex report


# To Make Less Fake :-)
* Store replication marker somewhere... But where?
* Stream object mode should be true or false?


# Features
* Pull events over http
* Push events over http
  * `pushTo('http://lw.com:4242')`
* Route to get events with filters (json path)
* Route to get folding status with filters (json path)
* `on('event', f)`


# Epics
* Ensure events rectification
* Avoid events duplication
* More friendly APIs
