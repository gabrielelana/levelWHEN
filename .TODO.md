# Roadblocks
* How to replicate a levelDB into another levelDB?
* How to avoid duplicated events?
  * If the source it's not reliable then check for existence of id before put?

# What to Try Next
* `at` should be generated by the receiver as `ms + inc(NNNNN)`
* We should have 3 indexes
  * `id -> event`
  * `at -> uuid`
  * `at-name -> uuid`
  * Others?
